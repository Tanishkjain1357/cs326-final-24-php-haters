# INNOVATIVE IDEA

As undergraduate students, we have realized that the main aspect, in having a successful academic career at university, is planning. Prior planning has always been advantageous even in the cases where everything does not go according to plan, as an individual always has a backup. Backups are only possible with prior planning. This is the main motive behind our idea of creating an all-in-one multi-aspect planner for undergraduate students. Our planner will help students to do the following:


- Plan out courses for future semesters
- Keep backups just in case a desired course is unavailable
- Provide a platform to plan out their day/week - add meetings, deadlines, reminders etc.
- Filter and highlight clubs and/or activities that pertain to their interest
- Provide resources that can help them get hands-on experience in research and/or industry


It relates to websites such as the UMass website which has all the information students need with regards to clubs/activities, research, courses, etc. along with spire which helps with scheduling courses, however, this idea aims to create a unified platform for students and also provides a customized plan that helps them focus on the information most relevant to them and also saves them the time to search through the plethora of information provided on multiple different websites/platforms.


# IMPORTANT COMPONENTS

- Courses per major (for a subset of majors initially) that can be in a semester-wise block-like format, can have a check box and a list of potential options for upcoming semesters
- A calendar with their course schedule and options for adding in personal agendas
- Clubs and extracurricular activities that will be provided based on the interests of the user
- Provide a list of all professors and what research (plus labs) they are doing. So a user can provide their academic interests and our web app can highlight research potentials that the user might find interesting.
- Internships from the Career Development Center to provide a list of internship opportunities for students (who can add their areas of interest)
