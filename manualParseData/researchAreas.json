        "description": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) research is advancing the frontier of computing by endowing machines with the abilities to solve problems that require high-level---sometimes human---expertise, perform complex tasks autonomously, learn from experience, interact and collaborate seamlessly with people, and cope effectively with uncertainty and missing information.  Current research in AI includes automated planning, autonomous systems, computational neuroscience and bio-computation, computer vision, heuristic search, intelligent tutoring systems, knowledge discovery and data mining, machine learning, multi-agent systems, natural language processing, probabilistic modeling and inference, reinforcement learning, robotics and human-robot interaction, search engines and search tools, sequential decision making and optimization. Applications include mobile robots that collaborate with people in an office environment, semi-autonomous driving, planning tools to protect endangered species, discovering trends in news and social media, K-12 tutoring systems, and reading the text of outdoor signs."

        "name": "Computational Biology and Bioinformatics",
        "description": "Computational Biology refers broadly to the application of mathematical modeling, high-throughput computing, data integration, and algorithm development to generate testable hypotheses about biological entities and processes. Using these approaches, we attempt to answer important questions in molecular biology, genetics, biologically-inspired computation, and neuroscience, such as how a protein folds, how genes are expressed and regulated, how system-level behavior arises from the genetic code, how evolutionary history can inform biological processes, how biological systems are able to process information robustly, and how they learn and adapt to the environment. Our research is fundamentally concerned with efficient approaches to traverse large search spaces, perform inferences over high dimensional data sets, formally integrate diverse biological knowledge, and model biological systems and their behavior. Bioinformatics refers to the data management and processing of biomolecular data often collected on a genome-wide scale. Computational biologists and bioinformaticists typically leverage data generated by modern high-throughput assays including microarrays, mass spectrometry, confocal microscopy, sequencing and other advances in biotechnology."

Classically, data management has focused on structured data, but it now also includes a variety of complex data types and settings. These include textual data, semi-structured data, graph-structure data, and continuous data streams, as well as data (regardless of type) that is incomplete, imprecise, or which represents probabilistic assertions rather than known facts."

These systems might use the World Wide Web or CD/DVD-ROM and asynchronous learning environments to provide lectures outside the classroom. They might provide customized responses and on-demand advice through intelligent interfaces, inference mechanisms and cognitive models of the learner. Much of the machine teaching research in computer science is multi-disciplinary, with strong ties to research in cognitive science, education, engineering, and to other computer science researchers in artificial intelligence, networking, machine learning, information retrieval and multimedia. Target applications include undergraduate and K-12 curricula, as well as industrial and medical training. Dozens of systems and courses have been deployed and evaluated, with tens of thousands of users across dozens of universities."

        "description": "Human Language Technologies refers to systems that understand, represent, analyze, and search archives and streams of written and spoken language. We now can talk to our phones to instantly search through billions of webpages and databases across multiple languages -- this was science fiction only 20 years ago. Looking forward, even more exciting developments are possible as we address fundamental research issues.  At UMass, we have developed major research groups with international reputations in information retrieval (IR) and natural language processing (NLP). Information Retrieval (IR) develops techniques for effective and efficient search of large archives of text.  Search engines now provide near-instant access to billions of pieces of information in multiple languages to millions of simultaneous users, retrieving and connecting web pages, video, social media, news, products, answers, scholarly articles, and many other types of information. They provide user interfaces to simplify the information-seeking \"conversation\" between user and machine.  IR research makes this possible and drives constant improvements for the future. Natural Language Processing (NLP) strives to get computers to understand human language. NLP has seen enormous progress, but current systems have a very shallow understanding of the rich subtleties in language. Our research integrates machine learning and computational linguistics to better extract knowledge and insights from text corpora, such as analysis of social media, news, scholarly articles, and computational social science applications. NLP is inherently multidisciplinary, and NLP-related research at UMass also involves our colleagues in linguistics and the social sciences."

To interact naturally with computers, we must have computers that can relate to their environment through visual and physical interactions, from recognizing the face of an approaching person to learning about dynamics by bouncing a ball. In robotics, our expertise ranges from sophisticated grasping techniques and novel motion planning methods to complex tool use and experimenting with new types of dynamically stable robots. In computer vision, our strengths include scene modeling, face identification, object recognition, and reading the text of signs in complex outdoor environments. Our graphics group focuses on high-speed realistic rendering techniques, intelligent 3D content creation techniques, processing 3D geometric data, and visualizing complex lighting effects. A major cross-cutting interest is the desire to model basic learning processes in humans and machines using data acquired from sensors mounted on robots and mobile video cameras. By adapting our computers' strategies of grasping, reaching, moving, and recognizing to real world data rather than to synthetic laboratory data, we are building systems robust enough to operate in realistic scenarios."
