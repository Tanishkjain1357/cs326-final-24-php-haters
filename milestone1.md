# Innovative Idea

As undergraduate students, we have realized that the main aspect, in having a successful academic career at university, is planning. Prior planning has always been advantageous even in the cases where everything does not go according to plan, as an individual always has a backup. Backups are only possible with prior planning. This is the main motive behind our idea of creating an all-in-one multi-aspect planner for undergraduate students. Our planner will help students to do the following:

Plan out courses for future semesters
Keep backups just in case a desired course is unavailable
Provide a platform to plan out their day/week - add meetings, deadlines, reminders etc.
Filter and highlight clubs and/or activities that pertain to their interest
Provide resources that can help them get hands-on experience in research and/or industry

# Important Data

- Courses per major (for a subset of majors initially) that can be in a semester-wise block-like format, can have a check box and a list of potential options for upcoming semesters
- A calendar with their course schedule and options for adding in personal agendas
- Clubs and extracurricular activities that will be provided based on the interests of the user
- Provide a list of all professors and what research (plus labs) they are doing. So a user can provide their academic interests and our web app can highlight research potentials that the user might find interesting.
- Internships from the Career Development Center to provide a list of internship opportunities for students (who can add their areas of interest)

# User Interface
